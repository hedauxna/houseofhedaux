  <div class="skywatch-intro">
    Welcome to the Garage—a gallery of motion, ambition, and electric dreams. This space celebrates the revolutionary spirit of Tesla, the cosmic aspirations of SpaceX, and the mind behind it all: Elon Musk. From road to orbit, here lies the pulse of progress.

    <p>Before I ever touched the wheel, I was already in love. Tesla wasn’t just a car brand—it was a vision I’d been quietly orbiting for years. I watched the reviews, 
    studied the specs, imagined the feel of the drive. But deep down, I never believed it would be achievable. It felt like something reserved for someone else’s 
    future.</p><p>Then one day, a colleague offered me the chance to take the wheel. That first drive was transformative. Smooth, silent, and alive with intelligence. 
    The tech, the safety, the power, the minimalism—it wasn’t just a vehicle, it was a companion. A brain on wheels. I knew instantly: I had to have one.</p><p>I 
    visited the local dealer, ran the numbers, and made it work. Before I knew it, I was driving my own Tesla Model 3 Long Range. All the anxiety I used to feel about 
    long-distance drives in an ICE car vanished. The Tesla met every expectation I’d built from years of YouTube deep dives—and then exceeded them. It’s a joy to 
    look at, a pleasure to clean, and a privilege to care for.</p><p>Since then, my Tesla has become part of my life’s rhythm. I’ve driven from one end of the country 
    to the other, often with Phoebe in the back seat, en route to dance competitions. Last year, we cruised to the South of France—and we’re doing it again this 
    Tuesday. I can’t wait.</p><p>Owning a Tesla isn’t just about driving. It’s about believing in a future that’s smarter, cleaner, and more connected. Elon Musk’s 
    vision resonates deeply with me—not just the cars, but the cosmic ambition, the refusal to settle, the relentless push toward progress. I admire it all.</p>
    <p>In the Garage of my digital mansion, Tesla lives as more than a machine. It’s a symbol of possibility. Of motion. Of electric dreams made real.</p>
