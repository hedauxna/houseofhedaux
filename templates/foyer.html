    Step inside the House of Hedaux. This is the Foyer—a quiet introduction to the soul of the mansion. Here you'll meet Nathan, the architect of this digital sanctuary, and trace the roots of a family whose stories echo through every room. From childhood memories to the blueprint of future dreams, this space invites you to pause, reflect, and begin.

  <div class="skywatch-main">
    I built this mansion to honor my father’s legacy and explore the fragments of my own. Every room holds a piece of me—some polished, some still in progress.
    <br><br>
    House of Hedaux is more than a website. It’s a sanctuary of memory, a blueprint of becoming. I’ve blended technology, storytelling, and personal history to create a space where the past and future meet in quiet conversation.
    <br><br>
    The blueprint itself is my metaphor: modular, expandable, and deeply intentional. Each room represents a facet of my life—bonsai seedlings in the Conservatory, skywatching in the Observatory, family roots in the Library. You’re invited to wander, pause, and reflect.
    <br><br>
    The floorplan evolves as I do. One day, it may host new wings, new stories, new echoes. But the foundation remains the same: curiosity, legacy, and the quiet joy of building something that lasts.
    <br><br>
    One day, this mansion will outlive me. That’s the hope. I’ve laid its foundations not just for myself, but for my children—and their children—to wander, contribute, and expand. New rooms will be built, old ones restored, stories added like bricks. House of Hedaux is more than memory; it’s inheritance. A place where the past is honored, the present is documented, and the future is invited to keep building.
