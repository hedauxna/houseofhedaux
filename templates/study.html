    <p>Step deeper into the House of Hedaux. This is the Study—a chamber of quiet ambition and earned wisdom. Here, the story of Nathan’s working life unfolds across 
    time: from dreams of flight to the grounded joy of fatherhood, from casino nights to factory days, and finally, to the luminous world of IT where passion and 
    purpose align.</p><p>The Study is more than a résumé. It’s a testament to adaptability, grit, and the kind of success that isn’t measured in titles, but in 
    transformation. Each entry is a page from a life reimagined—proof that even detours can lead to destiny.</p><p>This room invites you to trace the arc of a 
    career built not just on skill, but on love, sacrifice, and the quiet thrill of finding where you truly belong.</p>

    <p>I didn’t take the straight path. I took the one with turbulence, detours, and unexpected beauty.</p><p>When I left school, I stepped into the world of 
    aviation—Southend Airport, a flying school, and a dream to become an airline pilot. But life had other plans. The theory was tough, the finances tighter, and 
    circumstances shifted. That dream slipped through my fingers… and handed me something far greater. Had I taken flight, I might never have met my wife, never held 
    my four children in my arms. Fate, it seems, knows how to reroute us toward what truly matters.</p><p>From the skies to the casino floor, I dealt cards and met 
    my soulmate. Together, we left Essex behind and followed my parents to Lincolnshire, seeking a safer, steadier life for our growing family.</p><p>Then came the 
    factory years—Bakkavor, once Geest. I climbed the ranks, learned the rhythm of fresh food manufacturing, and spent 18 years as a business planner. Supply chain, 
    commercial, finance—I absorbed it all. But behind the spreadsheets and shift patterns, a quiet passion stirred: IT. A lifelong hobby, waiting patiently in the 
    wings.</p><p>Now, I work in tech. And I’ve never felt more at home.</p><p>The Study is where I archive this journey. Not just the roles I’ve held, but the lessons 
    they taught me. It’s a room built on resilience, gratitude, and the thrill of finding purpose in unexpected places.</p>
