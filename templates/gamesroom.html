    Welcome to the Games Room—a chamber of nostalgia, creativity, and quiet obsession. This is where my journey into digital realms began, long before the internet 
    was fast or the graphics were smooth. It started with the Commodore 64, where I painstakingly copied lines of BASIC code from the user manual just to hear a short 
    wave sound. I watched Dad conjure a race car on screen, dodging obstacles with a flick of the joystick, and something clicked: this wasn’t just play—it was 
    creation.<br><br>
    From the Amiga’s hypnotic soundtracks to the golden age of PC gaming in the '90s, each system became a stepping stone. World of Warcraft became a shared universe 
    for Hayley and me, a place where quests and companionship intertwined. Simulators drew me in deeper—more than just games, they were systems to understand, tweak, 
    and master. Realm Royale and World of Tanks brought Dad back into the fold, our battles echoing across generations.<br><br>
    Today, the Games Room is also a workshop. I tinker with Unreal Engine, sculpting levels, animating characters, and building mechanics like inventory systems and 
    player stats. HTML and Python have become tools in my digital toolkit, helping me evolve projects that blur the line between hobby and craft.<br><br>
    And soon, this room will become interactive. I’m building a mini-game to embed right here—a playable homage to the early days, where dodging pixelated obstacles 
    feels like time travel. Alongside it, a retro HTML adventure will unfold: part memoir, part mystery, part love letter to the era that shaped me. Visitors won’t 
    just read about the Games Room—they’ll play through it.<br><br>
    This room isn’t just about games—it’s about the joy of making, the thrill of learning, and the stories coded into every pixel. It’s a tribute to the worlds I’ve 
    explored, the ones I’ve built, and the ones still waiting to be born.
