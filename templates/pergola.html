  <div class="skywatch-intro"><p>Welcome to the back garden battleground where legends are made and laughter reigns supreme. For years, table tennis was a holiday treat—casual rallies on borrowed 
    tables, cheeky tuition from schoolmates and work colleagues, and the occasional surprise spin that left us grinning. Hayley’s grandma and grandad were the 
    original champions, hosting garden matches that echoed with joy and the clatter of paddles. The kids played under their watchful eyes, learning the rhythm of 
    the game and the rhythm of family.<br>
    And now, at last, we have our very own table. A place not just for play, but for memory-making. The rallies are longer, the spins sharper, and the laughter louder. 
    This is where the Hedaux league begins.
