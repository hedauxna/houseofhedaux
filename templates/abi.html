        Chapter I: The First Spark
<br>Abi was the first light in the House of Hedaux—a child who didn’t just see the world, she interpreted it. From early on, she wielded pencils and cameras like 
instruments of truth, capturing the world not as it was, but as it could be. Her creativity wasn’t just a hobby—it was a language, fluent and fierce. Childhood 
dramas? There were a few. From the moment she could grip a crayon (or as she called it, bardy), she was drawing her way into our hearts. “Bardy” became her first 
artistic declaration—a baby-word that somehow captured the essence of creativity before she even knew the word for it. If she was quiet, you could bet she was 
scribbling, smudging, or arranging colours with the focus of a tiny curator.
We’d ask her simple things, like “What colour is this?” and she’d reply with philosophical certainty:
“It’s a colour.”
“Yes, but what colour?”
“It’s a colour.”
And that was that. The world didn’t need labels—it just needed hues.
Her early years were a collage of sketchbooks, glitter spills, and photo experiments. She didn’t just draw — she documented.
But through it all, Abi remained a seeker—of beauty, of belonging, of her own voice. Her bedroom walls were less decoration, more declaration: 
“I am here, and I see things differently.”
<br><br>Chapter II: The Social Bloom
<br>At eighteen, the world cracked open. Abi embraced the freedom with gusto—nights out, laughter spilling over cocktails, and friendships forged in the fire of shared 
experience. She was magnetic, a storyteller in motion, always ready to toast to the moment.
<br><br>Chapter III: The Pandemic Pause
<br>Covid brought a strange interlude. As a warden at Gousto, she stood at the threshold of responsibility and restlessness. It wasn’t a role she loved, but it was a 
chapter she lived—proof of her grit when the world felt uncertain.
<br><br>Chapter IV: The Newcastle Experiment
<br>University in Newcastle was meant to be a canvas of creativity and connection. Media creation called to her, but the dorm walls echoed with tension. Her flatmates 
made life difficult, and the dream dimmed. Yet even in retreat, Abi chose herself—returning to Lincolnshire not in defeat, but in quiet defiance.
<br><br>Chapter V: The Vodafone Interlude
<br>Back home, she stepped into the world of retail, selling phones in her auntie’s store. It was here she met her partner—a serendipitous spark in a setting she 
didn’t love. The job may not have thrilled her, but the connection did.
<br><br>Chapter VI: The Present Pulse
<br>Now at Nationwide, Abi continues to navigate adulthood with a blend of practicality and passion. The bank may not be her final destination, but it’s a stepping 
stone—a place where she’s learning, earning, and still dreaming.
