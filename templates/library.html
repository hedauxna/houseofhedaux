            <h3>Tribute to Dad</h3>
            <div class="chapter-content">
        <p>My Father, My Compass</p><p>My father, Leslie Hedaux, was a man of many hobbies and ever-changing interests‚Äîa restless explorer of the world and of himself. 
            Born and raised in East London, he carried with him stories of resilience, like the time he was bullied on his way to school and had his lunch money taken. 
            He could be tough, too‚ÄîI remember hearing how his own father once chopped up his bike after he‚Äôd upset him. But beneath that steel was a man overflowing 
            with love for his wife, my mum, and for his children and grandchildren.</p><p>Before family life, he travelled the world with the navy. I don‚Äôt know much 
            about those years, but I do know he met my mum in Stanford-le-Hope in the 1970s, where they worked together. They wrote letters while he sailed‚Äîpages of 
            longing and devotion. They moved to South Africa for a time, where my brother Dan was born in 1976. Homesick, they returned to Essex, and I was born in 
            Orsett in 1978. Dad had so much time for us boys. It felt like he was living the childhood he never had‚Äîthrough us. Most weekends were spent racing 
            motocross around the country. He gave us an upbringing other kids could only dream of: skiing, go-karting, and summers in Carlucet, South of France. 
            He adored the culture, the food‚Äîespecially Rocamadour Cabecous and smoked duck.</p><p>We fished together often, searching for the perfect lake, casting 
            lines for carp, trout, and salmon. I remember wrapping ourselves in black bin bags in the Scottish rain, laughing through the discomfort. We took 
            narrowboat trips through English canals, navigating locks and tunnels, fishing off the side. He‚Äôd take me to Grays to buy stamps, always making it feel 
            like it was for me, though I knew it was for him.</p><p>He earned his private pilot‚Äôs license and took us flying to different airfields. He loved aircraft, 
            and he passed that love on to me. I had my first flying lesson at twelve. We flew in formation with a group called the Seaweeds, from Southend to North 
            Weald.</p><p>He introduced me to the casino. Our first night, we won on roulette‚Äîpure beginner‚Äôs luck. The second night, we lost it all. That was part of 
            the lesson, too. We often talked about gambling, not just the games but the psychology, the stories, the odds. At home, we‚Äôd host our own casino nights 
            with a proper setup: green baize, weighted chips, and official blackjack cards. It wasn‚Äôt about money. It was about theatre, strategy, and laughter. He 
            loved the ritual of it all, and I loved sharing it with him.</p><p>In his forties, cancer arrived. He sold his share in the fabrication business he‚Äôd 
            built‚Äîa hard decision, but one made for his health. He and Mum moved to Lincolnshire for a quieter life. I‚Äôd visit and find him on his PC, immersed in 
            flight simulators and virtual air traffic control. He kept busy‚Äîdriving the Spalding river taxi, selling seed at the Deeping St. Nicholas farm shop.
            </p><p>Later, we discovered World of Tanks. We played for hours. He wasn‚Äôt very good‚Äîhis gun often pointed skyward‚Äîbut he loved it. Eventually, his 
            grandson Josh joined us, and the three of us played together. Dad looked to the sky, just like I do. He tinkered with telescopes, collected stamps and 
            coins, and wore beautiful watches‚ÄîRolex, Breitling, and others. When we visited, he‚Äôd be on his computer, quiet but comforted by our presence. He‚Äôd slice 
            biltong, mussels, smoked duck, urging us to try. </p><p>In the end, the cancer returned‚Äîfaster, stronger. Yet he still cared for others, travelling any 
            distance to help someone in need. He never asked for money. He gave from the heart. In his final months, I‚Äôd drive him to hospital for treatment, and 
            even then, he couldn‚Äôt help but nag about my driving. It was his way of staying engaged, of still being my dad. Teaching me, correcting me, loving me‚Äîright 
            to the very end.</p><p>Leslie was a man of motion‚Äîalways learning, always tinkering, always giving. He lived with intensity and heart, pouring his energy 
            into his family, his passions, and the skies above. Whether flying planes, racing bikes, collecting stamps, or fishing lochs in bin bags, he made life 
            feel like an adventure. He gave us more than memories‚Äîhe gave us momentum. And though he‚Äôs gone, the echo of his curiosity, generosity, and quiet strength 
            still guides me. I see him in the sky, in the coins I inherited, in the way I build this mansion. He was my compass. He still is.</p>
